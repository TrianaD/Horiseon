# Horiseon
Module 1 Challenge 

## Description

In this challenge, we want to update the current code but to be optimized to follow accessibility standards and optimized for search engines. 

The funcition of the code should not be changed as well as following the Scout Rule (to leave the code cleaner than when you started) as changes are made to the code. 


## Acceptance Criteria

It is done when the following items are completed: 

* GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
